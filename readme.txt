Caldera Forms to post types and custom fields: front-end or back-end

== Description ==
A free addon for [Caldera Forms](http://wordpress.org/plugins/caldera-forms/) to create or edit posts, including custom post types and custom fields. Can be used as a standalone form for front-end editing and as a custom metabox generator in the post editor.

Other than using the automatic plugin installer from plugins page, You can extract the contents and upload the cf-metaboxes folder to /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

Configure the processor by setting the Post Types you want the metabox to be in, the Context and Priority. Then click Update Form.
